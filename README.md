A Community driven Web framework written in Go. Its performance is unique, seems to be the [fastest](#benchmarks) golang web framework was ever created.

Start using Iris Web Framework today. Iris is easy-to-learn while providing robust set of features for building modern & shiny web applications.

### Q: What makes iris significantly [faster](#benchmarks)?
*    First of all Iris is builded on top of the [fasthttp](https://github.com/valyala/fasthttp)
*    Iris uses the same algorithm as the BSD's kernel does for routing (call it Trie)
*    Iris can detect what features are used and what don't and optimized itself before server run.
*    Middlewares and Plugins are 'light' , that's a principle.

## Third Party Middlewares


>Note: After v1.1 most of the third party middlewares are incompatible, I'm putting a big effort to convert all of these to work with Iris,
if you want to help please do so (pr).

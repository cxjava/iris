### Q: What makes iris significantly [faster](#benchmarks)?
*    First of all Iris is builded on top of the [fasthttp](https://github.com/valyala/fasthttp)
*    Make use of the algorithm which the BSD's kernel uses for internal routing
*    Iris can detect what features are used and what don't and optimize itself
